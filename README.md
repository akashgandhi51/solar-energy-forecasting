### Comprehensive Documentation for Solar Energy Forecasting Tool

---

## Introduction

This open-source tool is designed to forecast solar energy production and suggest optimal angles for solar panel placement. Utilizing publicly available environmental data, the tool provides daily and hourly solar power output forecasts for a specified location. Additionally, it calculates the optimal tilt angle for solar panels to maximize energy capture based on seasonal sun positions.

## Features

- **Solar Power Forecasting:** Generate hourly and daily forecasts for solar power generation using environmental data.
- **Optimal Tilt Angle Calculation:** Determine the best angles for solar panel placement throughout the year to enhance energy production.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy to use functions for fetching forecasts and tilt angle recommendations with just a few inputs.

## Dependencies

The tool requires Python 3.6+ and the following libraries:

- pandas
- lightgbm
- matplotlib
- requests
- geopy

To install these dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install pandas lightgbm matplotlib requests geopy
```

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourgithubusername/solar-energy-forecasting.git
cd solar-energy-forecasting
```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

Follow the dependencies installation step mentioned above.

## Usage

To use the tool, you need to provide latitude and longitude coordinates of your location, the available plant capacity in MW, and an API key for fetching weather data.

Example usage:

```python
from solar_power_forecast import solar_power_forecast

# User Inputs
api_key = 'your_api_key_here'
plant_capacity = 100  # in MW
lat, lon = 40.7128, -74.0060  # Example: New York City

# Forecast Solar Power and Calculate Optimal Tilt Angle
forecast, optimal_tilt_angle = solar_power_forecast(lat, lon, plant_capacity, api_key)

print(forecast)
print("Optimal Tilt Angle:", optimal_tilt_angle)
```
